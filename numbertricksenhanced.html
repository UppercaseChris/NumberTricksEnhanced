                It's time we took things a step further. In this project we built upon the previous project. Before we made a little application that performs various calculations 
                to an inputed value with the end result always being 7. However we didn't take into consideration the idea the user could have entered a value that wasn't an integer. 
                That is no bueno and must be resolved. To display the changed made for this project I created an individual html file as well as an individual JavaScript file to hold the changed code,
                which in this case was fairly simple. Because we used a parseInt function, if the user tries to be sneaky and place a demical number rather than a whole number, this function simply removes the decimal aspect and takes
                the present whole number. Now this goes through a while loop with the condition being if the variable assigned the prompt is returning an integer value or not. 
                This loop will go on continously until the user enters a proper value. 

                Secondary ideas for this were to use a for loop with a max index of 3. After three failed the attempts the program would say something along the lines of
                "OH i guess you didn't wanna play". I also considered the idea of adding an exit of sorts incase the user didn't want to play at all, since the program
                is launched upon the opening of the site.
